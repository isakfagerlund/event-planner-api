# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current Hono API implementation has all functionality consolidated in a single `index.ts` file, making it difficult to maintain and scale. This feature will restructure the API into a more organized, modular architecture with proper separation of concerns, following best practices for API development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API to have a clear separation between routing, business logic, and data access, so that the codebase is more maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API is restructured THEN the system SHALL separate routes, controllers, and services into distinct modules
2. WHEN a new endpoint needs to be added THEN the developer SHALL be able to add it without modifying the main application file
3. WHEN business logic changes THEN the system SHALL isolate changes to service layer without affecting routing
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated database connection module

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper route organization with RESTful endpoints, so that the API follows standard conventions and is easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are accessed THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints at `/api/events` path
2. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/events` THEN the system SHALL return all events
3. WHEN a POST request is made to `/api/events` THEN the system SHALL create a new event
4. WHEN a PUT request is made to `/api/events/:id` THEN the system SHALL update the specified event
5. WHEN a DELETE request is made to `/api/events/:id` THEN the system SHALL delete the specified event
6. WHEN invalid routes are accessed THEN the system SHALL return appropriate 404 responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and validation middleware, so that the API provides consistent error responses and validates input data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid JSON is sent THEN the system SHALL return a 400 error with descriptive message
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return a 422 error with validation details
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL return a 500 error with appropriate message
4. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL validate input using Zod schemas
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean project structure with organized directories, so that code is easy to navigate and follows TypeScript/Node.js conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL organize code into logical directories (routes, controllers, services, middleware)
2. WHEN new features are added THEN the system SHALL follow the established directory structure
3. WHEN imports are used THEN the system SHALL use consistent import paths and barrel exports
4. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL centralize configuration in dedicated modules
5. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all components from the main entry point

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types and interfaces, so that the code has strong type safety and better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use properly typed response objects
2. WHEN request data is processed THEN the system SHALL use typed request interfaces
3. WHEN services are called THEN the system SHALL use typed service interfaces
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain Drizzle ORM type safety
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL use typed error objects
